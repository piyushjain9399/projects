Playlist Transfer App/Website

Idea is:
Input provided would be a link to a spotify playlist. 
The app would then convert that spotify playlist into a YTMusic playlist and generate a link for the YTMusic playlist.
The app would then provide the user with the link to the YTMusic playlist which he/she/they can use.
