Number Guessing Game

V1:
Running the numberGuessing.py will run the number guessing game
where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100, which will be 
randomly generated by the application, in the minimum number of attempts.


V2:
Including the feature to store and compare against the highScore which is maintained
in a highScore.txt file in the same directory. This feature currently works only for 
Unix based OS (because of the '/' based file directory structure).

V2.1:
Making the highScore functionality working for Windows based systems as well. 

V3:
Adding a function to select the range of the guessing range between:
1. 1 to 100
2. 1 to 200
